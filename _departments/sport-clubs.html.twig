The [Sport Clubs program](https://www.csun.edu/as/sport-clubs) provides CSUN students an opportunity to participate in regionally and nationally competitive sports and recreational activities. The program is designed to allow each CSUN student a chance to participate in a sport club individually or as a member of a team.

Each club is formed, developed, governed and administered by student members. Student leadership, interest and participation are essential elements of a successful sport club.
